         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
             <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
             <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
             <li>½ (8 ounce) package fresh spinach, chopped</li>
             <li>1 (4 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
             <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
             <li>1 (8 ounce) package crumbled goat cheese</li>
             <li>½ (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
             <li>1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
         </ul>
         <ol>
             <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
             </li>
             <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
             </li>
             <li>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Saute spinach and mushrooms in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add to ziti.
             </li>
             <li>
                Add ricotta cheese, goat cheese, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese to the ziti mixture; combine thoroughly. 
                Mix in spaghetti sauce and transfer to the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.
             </li>
             <li>
                Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
             </li>
         </ol>
